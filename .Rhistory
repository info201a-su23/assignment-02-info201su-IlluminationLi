In this assignment, you will work with data from [Count Love](https://countlove.org/), data that is ocassionally [cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/black-lives-matter-protest.html) by the *New York Times* when reporting on US demonstrations.

# 1a: Load the `stringr` package, which you will use later.
library(stringr)
# 1b: Load the data from https://countlove.org/data/data.csv (Variable: `protests`)
protests <- read.csv("protests.csv")
# 1b: Load the data from https://countlove.org/data/data.csv (Variable: `protests`)
protests <- read.csv("data.csv")
# 1c: Use an R function to determine how many protests are in the dataset? (Variable: `num_protests`)
num_protests <- nrow(data)
# 1c: Use an R function to determine how many protests are in the dataset? (Variable: `num_protests`)
num_protests <- nrow(protests)
#                                         Note 04.
#     *BEST PRACTICE:* Use View() to open and examine the dataset. Some key questions to ask:
#        1. What information is available?
#        2. Are there missing values (NA, which means "Not Available.") or odd values?
#        3. What are the column names (sometimes called variables or features)?
View(protests)
# 1d: Use an R function to determine how many how many values (also known as
#    attributes or features) have been recorded for each protest (Variable: `num_features`)
num_features <- ncol(protests)
#                                         Note 05.
## Part 2: Attendees ----
# In this part, you will explore the number of people who participated
# in the protests.
num_attendees <- protests$Attendees
